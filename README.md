# MisdiagGuard for misdiagnosis prediction and pattern recognition
### This repository stores the paper- *MisdiagGuard: A multi-functional system for predicting probability of clinical diagnosis error and performing pattern recognition* related code and demo data. Anyone using this code for academic research please cite it. Thanks!
### The code continues to be updated.
#### Preprocessing.ipynb: EMR data were preprocessed and prepared in advance for expert labeling by finding repeat admissions within 14 days with different diagnoses for the same patient.
#### traditional_machine_learnin: Here, traditional machine learning models are used to train and learn.
#### ADASYN_and_violin_plot.ipynb: ADASYN was used for data augmentation and violin drawing.
#### data_augumentation.ipynb: The pre-trained model was augmented with data using translation (taking BERT as an example), and the indicators were obtained.
