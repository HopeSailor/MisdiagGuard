# MisdiagGuard for misdiagnosis prediction and pattern recognition
### This repository stores the paper- *Integrating Prior Knowledge with Multi-source Heterogeneous Data for Clinical Misdiagnosis Risk Prediction and Feature Identification* related code and demo data. Anyone using this code for academic research please cite it. Thanks!
### The code continues to be updated.
#### Here's how each ccode snippet is used.

| EMR data were preprocessed and prepared in advance for expert labeling by finding repeat admissions within 14 days with different diagnoses for the same patient. | Here, traditional machine learning models are used to train and learn. | ADASYN was used for data augmentation and violin drawing. | The pre-trained model was augmented with data using translation (taking BERT as an example), and the indicators were obtained. |
